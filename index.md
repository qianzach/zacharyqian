## Zachary Qian

Hi there, my name is Zachary Qian. I'm studying Applied Mathematics and Bioinformatics at UCLA. After graduation, I intend to pursue a PhD in Statistics or Biostatistics in hopes of furthering my passion in the quantitative sciences.

I have worked on genetics problems with quantitative approaches, specifically in differential gene exprression, biomarker discovery from fMRI imaging, and other high-dimensional omics data.

I'm particularly interested in high-dimensional data, statistical imaging, and applications to both classical machine learning and deep learning. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher with Dr. Richard Ahn in the Hoffmann Lab of the Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences at UCLA, as well as with Dr. Jian Kang as a part of the University of Michigan's summer BDSI fellowship.

Aside from my research, I enjoy playing hockey, hiking, walking my dog, and cheering on the Chicago Blackhawks, Cubs, and Bears.
